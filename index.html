        <p>My name is Rick Shaw.  I am a professional project manager (PMP) and I am currently self employed as a program manager and project manager consultant.  I am married with three grown boys.  I enjoy photography, camping, and cruising.  I am from New Zealand, but now live in Calgary, AB Canada.  I am enrolled in the software development program and hope to incorporate that knowledge in to my current consulting work. </p>
