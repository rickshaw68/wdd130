                        Cheryl from Denver - We had the most memorable family experience imaginable.  Guides were fantastic, everyone was friendly, and this truly was a trip of a lifetime.

                        David from Vancouver - I came for a true adventure, and that's exactly what I got.  Our guide, Tina, was amazing.  Super friendly and knowledgable about the river and surrounding area.  She took us on some amazing rapids and kept us all safe at the same time.  I will definately do this again!

                        Mike from Idaho - I'm in love!  Everything about this place and the people is beyone amazing, I love everything about it.  I did the Rev It Up trip and it was the perfect mix of relaxing river float to exciting, heart pounding rapids.  Our guides were fantastic and entertaining.  They took great care of us from preparing us for the river to picking us up after our trip and bringing us back to base camp.  Everything was top notch and I would give 6 stars if I could.  I'll be back!
